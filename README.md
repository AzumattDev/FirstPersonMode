# Description

### Simple mod that allows First Person. It moves the camera into the player's head. It "hides" what is needed either through culling the character model or hiding the head by shrinking it (configuration value).

`This mod uses a file watcher. If the configuration file is not changed with BepInEx Configuration manager, but changed in the file directly, upon file save, it will update the settings.`
